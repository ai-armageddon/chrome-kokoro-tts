## Development

This extension is designed to work with a local Kokoro TTS API instance. The API handles all the text-to-speech processing, while this extension provides the browser interface.

### Project Structure

- `background.js` - Manages communication with the Kokoro TTS API
- `content.js` - Handles in-page text selection and play button
- `popup/` - Contains the extension's popup interface
- `offscreen/` - Manages audio playback in a separate context

## Troubleshooting

- **"Error playing audio"**: Ensure the Kokoro TTS API is running on `http://localhost:8000`
- **No sound**: Check your system volume and ensure the API is properly configured
- **Connection issues**: Verify no other service is using port 8000
